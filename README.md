## Introduction

Leaf is a Machine Intelligence Framework engineered by software developers, not
scientists. It was inspired by the brilliant people behind TensorFlow, Torch,
Caffe, Rust and numerous research papers and brings modularity, performance and
portability to deep learning. Leaf is lean and tries to introduce minimal
technical debt to your stack.

Leaf is a few months old, but thanks to its architecture and Rust already one of
the fastest Machine Intelligence Frameworks in the world.

> See more Deep Neural Networks benchmarks on [Deep Learning Benchmarks][deep-learning-benchmarks-website].

Leaf is portable. Run it on CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs, on machines with an OS, or on
machines without one. Run it with OpenCL or CUDA. Credit goes to
[Collenchyma][collenchyma] and Rust.

Leaf is part of the [Autumn][autumn] Machine Intelligence Platform, which is
working on making AI algorithms 100x more computationally efficient. Bringing
real-time, offline AI to smartphones and embedded devices.

We see Leaf as the core of constructing high-performance machine intelligence
applications. Leafs' design makes it easy to publish independent modules to make
e.g. deep reinforcement learning, visualization and monitoring, network
distribution, [automated preprocessing][cuticula] or scaleable production
deployment easily accessible for everyone.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Rust you can install it as detailed [here][rust_download],
and we recommend taking a look at the [official Getting Started Guide][rust_getting_started].

If you are using Cargo, just add Leaf to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
leaf = "0.2.0"
```

If you are using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can
call:

```bash
cargo add leaf
```
[rust_download]: https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html
[rust_getting_started]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/getting-started.html
[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

If you are on a machine that doesn't have support for CUDA or OpenCL you
can selectively enable them like this in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
leaf = { version = "0.2.0", default-features = false }

[features]
default = ["native"] # include only the ones you want to use, in this case "native"
native  = ["leaf/native"]
cuda    = ["leaf/cuda"]
opencl  = ["leaf/opencl"]
```


## Examples

We are providing a [Leaf examples repository][leaf-examples], where we and
others publish executable machine learning models built with Leaf. It features
a CLI for easy usage and has a detailed guide in the [project
README.md][leaf-examples].

And Leaf comes with an examples directory as well, which features popular neural
networks (e.g. Alexnet, Overfeat, VGG). To run them on your machine, just follow
the install guide, clone this repoistory and then run

```bash
# The examples currently require CUDA support.
cargo run --release --example benchmarks
```

## Ecosystem / Extensions

We design Leaf and the other crates of the [Autumn Platform][autumn] to be as modular
and extensible as possible. More helpful crates you can use with Leaf:

- [**Cuticula**][cuticula]: Preprocessing Framework for Machine Learning
- [**Collenchyma**][collenchyma]: Portable, HPC-Framework on any hardware with CUDA, OpenCL, Rust

[cuticula]: https://github.com/autumnai/cuticula
[collenchyma]: https://github.com/autumnai/collenchyma

## Support / Contact

- With a bit of luck you can find us online on the #rust-machine-learing IRC at irc.mozilla.org,
- but we are always approachable on [Gitter/Leaf][gitter-leaf]
- For bugs and feature requests, you can create a [Github issue][leaf-issue]
- And for more private matters, send us a mail straight to our inbox developers@autumnai.com.

## Q&A

#### _Why Rust?_

The current hardware just recently became strong enough to support real-world
usage of machine intelligence e.g. super-human image recognition, self-driving
cars, etc.. To take advantage of the computational power of the underlying
hardware from GPUs to clusters you need a low-level language that allows for
control of memory. But to make machine intelligence widely accessible you want
to have a high-level comfortable abstraction over the underlying hardware.

Rust allows us to cross this chasm.
Rust promises performance like C/C++ but with safe memory-control. For now we
can use C Rust wrappers for performant libraries. But in the future Rust
rewritten libraries will have the advantage of zero-cost safe memory control,
that will make large, parallel learning networks over CPUs and GPUs more
feasible and more reliable to develop. The development of these future libraries
is already under way e.g. [Glium][glium].

On the usability side, Rust offers a trait-system, that makes it easy for
researchers and hobbyists alike to extend and work with Leaf as if Leaf would
have been written in a higher-level language such as Ruby, Python, Java, etc.

#### _Who can use Leaf?_

We develop Leaf under the MIT open source license, which, paired with the easy
access and performance, makes Leaf a first-choice option for researchers and
developers alike.

#### _Why did you open source Leaf?_

We believe strongly in machine intelligence and think that it will have a major
impact on future innovations, products and our society. At Autumn, we experienced
a lack of common and well engineered tools for machine learning and therefore
started to create a modular toolbox for machine learning in Rust. We hope that
by making our work open source, we will speed-up research and development of
production-ready applications and make their work easier as well.

#### _Who is Autumn?_

Autumn is a startup working on automated decision making. Autumn was started by
two developers MJ and Max. The startup is located in Berlin and recently
received a pre-seed investment from Axel Springer and Plug&Play.
